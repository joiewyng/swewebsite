  <h1> Frequently Asked Questions </h1>
  <p> When are the best times to hold an information session? </p>
  <p> Classes officially end at 4:25pm each day. Career Services would like to
    standardize session times, and so we will be offering sessions at 4:30pm, 6:00pm
    , and 7:30pm. For engineers, Tuesday and Thursday evenings are preliminary
    (midterm) exam nights. To avoid possible conflicts, please see the fall
    preliminary exam schedule or fall final exam schedule. Exams for the
    following courses are large lectures and tend to be busy times for
    engineers: MATH 1910, 1920, 2930, 2940, PHYS 1112, 2213, 2214, CHEM 2090,
    CS courses, ENGRD courses, and ENGRI courses. </p>

  <p> How do I gauge the anticipated attendance at a session? </p>
  <p> Although we can provide you with a number, we feel that it is better for
    companies to anticipate their attendance as you will know best what your
    turnout would be. The average number of students is typically 30. The base
    prices for the refreshment options are determined by this average number. </p>

  <p> When is the latest I can cancel? </p>
  <p> One week prior notice to SWE Corporate Relations Directors
    (cornell.swe.cr@gmail.com) is required for cancellations.
    Cancellations made 7 days or less than the date of the session will
    result in a charge of half of the base price of a session. Less than 24
    hours notice will result in a charge for the full price of the session.
    If you cancel at least 7 days prior to your scheduled info session,
    you will be fully refunded. </p>

  <p> Why did my room reservation change from what was confirmed?</p>
  <p> Professors who make requests for academic purposes have priority
    over any other type of reservation. If such an event happens, we will
    find the next available location in closest proximity to the original
    reservation. We will send out emails and announcements to students about
    the location change. Additionally, we will post signs and have a
    liaison to redirect students to your new session location the day of your
    session. </p>

  <p> Can I opt to have a closed session for selected interviewees only?</p>
  <p> Yes, you can choose to not advertise your session to the general campus
    community. We will notify Engineering Career Services of your request and
    they will notify only the list of interviewees.</p>

  <p> When is payment due?</p>
  <p> Payment is due one to two weeks after an info session. </p>

  <p> How do I pay?</p>
  <p> We will send you a payment link and invoice. For tax and federal ID,
    please email us at cornell.swe.cr@gmail.com.
  </p>

  <p> How soon can I expect a confirmation after I submit my request?
  <p>
  <p> Within a week. We will work on getting your request processed as soon
    as possible. Turnaround time can be as early as 24 hours.
  </p>

  <p> When is the latest I can request to coordinate an information session with SWE?
  <p>
  <p> In order for SWE to provide the highest quality service, all session
    details must be finalized at least one week prior to the desired date.
    Ordering food and reserving a room is never a problem, however, it does
    take one week for room requests to be processed and confirmed. At least a
    week is necessary to properly publicize an information session and ensure
    the session has sufficient number of liaisons and volunteers. Since session
    details may take several days to finalize - especially if you have
    any questions about the session options - we recommend that session requests
    are made at least 14 days prior to the desired date.
  </p>
